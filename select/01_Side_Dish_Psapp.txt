From your point of view
Things look skewed
Like when you're wearing the wrong glasses (glasses)
But you're not (you're not, not)

You're the main event (main event)
Lovely center-spread
You are a punchline
To stick in my head

We'll get you over on our side
We'll get you over on our side
O-O-O-Over on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side

Please unravel me
Tidy up my binary
Have a cup of tea
And then we'll go home

Peel (peel) a page like a fruit
Get to the root
Get to the magic

We'll get you over on our side
We'll get you over on our side
We'll get you over on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side
We'll get you over (over) on our side
